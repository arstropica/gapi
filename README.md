## Google Analytics HTTP API

## Description
The client uses a direct HTTP authorization via Google credentials to log in to the Analytics account and then retrieves, via curl, and parses an XML feed based on RESTful style query. Please note that this is neither the most secure or recommended method of accessing Googleâ€™s API and there is no guarantee that they will continue to support the method with future API releases. 

## Notes
The repository contains the PHP class and a test client for exploration. Feel free to modify and use as needed.
